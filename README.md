DESCRIPTION OF TASK 3:
As part of my internship at CodTech, I successfully completed Task 3, which involved building an AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP). To accomplish this task, I chose Jupyter Notebook as my development platform due to its user-friendly interface and interactive code execution, which made testing and debugging the chatbot easier. I used Python as the programming language, which is widely used for AI and machine learning projects. For implementing NLP functionalities, I worked with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. This library helped me tokenize, parse, and understand user input, allowing the chatbot to respond accurately to queries. I started by installing necessary packages such as nltk, and then I created a list of pattern-response pairs that defined how the chatbot should react to various inputs. Using the Chat and reflections modules from NLTK, I built a simple rule-based chatbot that could handle greetings, answer basic questions, and provide polite responses. I thoroughly tested the chatbot using different inputs to ensure it responded appropriately and smoothly. The output was a fully functional chatbot script that worked via the command line or notebook cell, where the user could interact by typing questions and receiving replies in real time. This task is highly applicable in real-world scenarios, especially in areas such as customer support, virtual assistants, educational help desks, and website FAQs. Organizations and businesses often use such chatbots to automate customer interaction, reduce workload on support staff, and provide 24/7 assistance to users. The skills I gained from this project are valuable in AI development, especially in understanding human language and processing it efficiently using code. Additionally, through this task, I learned the basics of conversational design, how to structure user queries and responses, and how to improve chatbot performance using pattern matching. I also explored how this simple chatbot could be extended using more advanced tools like spaCy, transformer models, or even connected to a web interface using Flask or Tkinter for GUI-based applications. Overall, the tools I used include Python, Jupyter Notebook, NLTK library, and basic command-line interfaces. The experience enhanced my understanding of artificial intelligence, NLP techniques, and real-world chatbot deployment. Completing this task not only strengthened my programming and logical skills but also boosted my confidence to take on more complex AI projects in the future.
